              easily to create Third party Ad accounts & purchase Google,
              Microsoft, Facebook and Instagram advertisements from within your
              Advertorial Hub account (collectively, the “Advertising Buying
              Feature”)

              <li>
                The Advertising Buying Feature is an add-on to your Advertorial
                Hub account and will be billed as such. When creating an
                advertising campaign through the Advertising Buying Feature, you
                will be asked to select a maximum budget for your advertising
                campaign. You agree to pay the amount chosen as your maximum
                budget up front, and your credit card will be charged for this
                amount in its entirety. Ads will then be placed by Google,
                Microsoft or Facebook(including Instagram) on Your behalf
                according to the criteria you select using the Advertising
                Buying Feature until your maximum budget is reached. In certain
                circumstances, however, your entire budget may not be exhausted.
                Any unused portion of your budget will be credited to your
                account as an “Advertising Credits (Balance)” and may be used
                toward the purchase of future advertising campaigns with the
                Advertising Buying Feature. Advertising Credits may not be used
                to purchase or pay for other Advertorial Hub services.
