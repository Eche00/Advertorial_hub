            crime. When you are using our secure online payment pages, your
            payment is processed by a third party payment processor, who

            to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any
            legal obligation or to enforce or apply our terms of use or to

            When you give us personal information, we take steps to ensure that

            appear on the bottom of web browsers such as Microsoft Internet
            Explorer. Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are
            transmitted normally over the Internet, and this can never be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to
            protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security
            oxf any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own
            risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to
            ensure its security on our systems. Where we have given (or where
            you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain
            parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password
            confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
